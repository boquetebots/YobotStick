title Yobot Chess

REM ===========================================================================
REM  Play Chess.bat - double click this to run the show
REM ===========================================================================
REM
REM  It starts the chess program, waits until the display page is genuinely
REM  ready, opens it in your normal browser and puts it fullscreen.
REM
REM  THIS BLACK WINDOW IS THE SHOW. Leave it alone while you are playing.
REM  Closing it stops everything - the server and both robots.
REM
REM  The three buttons for starting the robots are on the page itself.
REM
REM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  SETTINGS - change the numbers below and save. Nothing else to edit.
REM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

REM  How strong the robots play. beginner, club, strong, expert, max, or a
REM  number from 1320 to 3190. Weaker is better for an audience: pieces hang,
REM  sacrifices land, somebody actually gets checkmated.
set STRENGTH=club

REM  Seconds of silence between one robot finishing and the other starting.
REM  Raise it if they sound rushed, lower it if the game drags.
set GAP=0.8

REM  How far behind a robot must be before it gives up, in hundredths of a
REM  pawn. -900 is about a queen down. This is the main control on how long
REM  a game lasts. Use 0 to turn resigning off.
set RESIGN=-900

REM  Where the Mac is, so the "Start Goldie" button on the page can launch
REM  her over the network. Delete the word REM from the next line and put the
REM  Mac's real address in. Leave it as it is to start Goldie by hand.
REM set MAC=192.168.50.20

REM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  Nothing below here needs changing.

cd /d "%~dp0"

REM  Which command runs Python on this computer. Some machines have "python",
REM  some only have "py". Checking is quicker than explaining the difference.
REM  Written out longhand on purpose. The one-line version of this using &&
REM  looks tidier and is wrong: cmd splits the line before the "if" is
REM  decided, so the second half can run when the first half never did.
REM  Yobot's own Python sandbox comes FIRST when it is there. The robot
REM  project (OhbotPi2) builds one at %USERPROFILE%\yobot-venv and puts the
REM  Azure voice and the USB driver in it, NOT in the system Python. Chess
REM  borrows both, so with a robot plugged in it must run out of that same
REM  sandbox or the robot cannot speak - while the board, the engine and the
REM  demo all carry on working, which is what makes it so hard to spot.
REM  Added 2026-09-17. SETUP.bat has the whole story.
set PY=
REM  --- STICK BUILD: the order below is deliberately different from the
REM  --- repo version. See chess-overrides in the YobotStick repo.
REM
REM  The stick carries its own complete Python in its own python folder, with
REM  every package already in it. That one must win, and it must be tried
REM  BEFORE %USERPROFILE%\yobot-venv. The repo version tries the venv first,
REM  which is right on an installed machine and wrong on the stick:
REM
REM    - on a stranger's laptop there is no venv, so it fell through to the
REM      system "python" - which has none of the packages, so chess died.
REM    - on a laptop that DOES have a venv (Michael's own PC), it ran the
REM      venv instead of the stick. It worked here and nowhere else, which
REM      is exactly what makes this kind of bug survive testing.
REM
REM  Same order the robot project already uses in Windows\yobot-launcher.bat.

REM  Open the browser in the background, once the page is actually up.
REM
REM  It has to WAIT. Opening the browser straight away gives "cannot reach
REM  this page", because Stockfish takes a few seconds to wake up - and the
REM  natural reaction to that is to think the whole thing is broken.
REM
REM  Then F11, which is the same key you would press yourself. Windows has no
REM  way to make an unknown browser start up fullscreen: only Chrome and Edge
REM  take a fullscreen switch, and using one of those would ignore whichever
REM  browser you actually chose. So this opens YOUR browser and presses the
REM  key. If it does not take, press F11 yourself - that is all it is doing.
