title Yobot Chess - a guest plays the robot

REM ===========================================================================
REM  Play a Human.bat - double click this when someone wants a turn
REM ===========================================================================
REM
REM  ONE laptop, ONE robot, ONE guest. This is the everyday setup.
REM
REM  It starts the game, opens the board on this screen and goes fullscreen.
REM  The guest taps a piece, taps where it should go, and the robot answers -
REM  out loud, with its mouth moving.
REM
REM  Nothing else is needed. No second computer, no network, no Mac, no Pi.
REM
REM  THIS BLACK WINDOW IS THE SHOW. Leave it alone while you are playing.
REM  Closing it stops everything.
REM
REM  For two robots playing EACH OTHER, use "Play Chess.bat" instead.
REM
REM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  SETTINGS - change these and save. Nothing else to edit.
REM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

REM  Which colour the GUEST plays. white or black.
REM  White moves first, which is what most people expect. The robot takes
REM  whichever colour is left.
set GUEST=white

REM  How hard the robot tries. friendly, beginner, club, strong, expert, max,
REM  or a number from 1320 to 3190.
REM
REM  LEAVE THIS ALONE unless you have a reason. "friendly" is deliberate: at
REM  club strength a guest loses every single game, and the next person stops
REM  asking for a turn. Friendly still punishes a free piece, so winning
REM  means something.
set STRENGTH=friendly

REM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  Nothing below here needs changing.
REM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

cd /d "%~dp0"

REM  Which command runs Python on this computer. Some machines have "python",
REM  some only have "py". Written out longhand on purpose - the tidier
REM  one-line version using ^&^& is wrong, because cmd splits the line before
REM  the "if" has been decided.
REM  Yobot's own Python sandbox comes FIRST when it is there. The robot
REM  project (OhbotPi2) builds one at %USERPROFILE%\yobot-venv and puts the
REM  Azure voice and the USB driver in it, NOT in the system Python. Chess
REM  borrows both, so with a robot plugged in it must run out of that same
REM  sandbox or the robot cannot speak - while the board, the engine and the
REM  demo all carry on working, which is what makes it so hard to spot.
REM  Added 2026-09-17. SETUP.bat has the whole story.
set PY=
REM  --- STICK BUILD: the order below is deliberately different from the
REM  --- repo version. See chess-overrides in the YobotStick repo.
REM
REM  The stick carries its own complete Python in its own python folder, with
REM  every package already in it. That one must win, and it must be tried
REM  BEFORE %USERPROFILE%\yobot-venv. The repo version tries the venv first,
REM  which is right on an installed machine and wrong on the stick:
REM
REM    - on a stranger's laptop there is no venv, so it fell through to the
REM      system "python" - which has none of the packages, so chess died.
REM    - on a laptop that DOES have a venv (Michael's own PC), it ran the
REM      venv instead of the stick. It worked here and nowhere else, which
REM      is exactly what makes this kind of bug survive testing.
REM
REM  Same order the robot project already uses in Windows\yobot-launcher.bat.

REM  Open the browser in the background, once the page is actually up.
REM
REM  It has to WAIT. Opening the browser straight away gives "cannot reach
REM  this page", because Stockfish takes a few seconds to wake up - and the
REM  natural reaction to that is to think the whole thing is broken.
REM
REM  Then F11, which is the same key you would press yourself. Windows has no
REM  way to make an unknown browser start up fullscreen, so this opens YOUR
REM  browser and presses the key. If it does not take, press F11 yourself -
REM  that is all it is doing.
